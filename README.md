This is a place where I put my feedback of the study.

# Hash Table
Hash Table contains keys and values, in general, keys could include array elements, and values include record of the array length or some marked data, using hash table could reduce the time complexity and traverse one time of the map to record and update data at the same time. Idealy, the time complexity can reduce to O(n).
## key > array
## values > record data
